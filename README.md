# ChatGPT_Code_Project

## Objective:
*To measure the accuracy of code generated by ChatGPT.*

A variety of programming tasks will be selected based on level of difficulty from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/). ChatGPT will be prompted to complete these programming tasks in Python. Tests will be created in order to check the accuracy of the code generated by ChatGPT. ChatGPT will be prompted with each programming task three times. In the event of errors being present in the generated code, ChatGPT will be prompted to fix those errors. Three attempts will be made for debugging.

**_Each attempt will be measured by the following metrics:_**
* Did the code run with compilation or runtime errors? *(Yes or No)*
* How many of the three attempts ran successfully? *(0 - 3)*
* Was the output of the code as expected? *(Is there a presence of logical errors? Yes or No)*
* If errors were present, was ChatGPT able to remedy them?
    * How many error remedy attempts we made before success? 
    *(if less than or equal to 3)*
